                    <h3>Story</h3>
                    <p>The story of Hellblade is based on Celtic and Norse mythology and follows the story of a Pict warrior named Senua as she embarks on a very personal journey through a hellish underworld.</p>
                    <p>Senua's people, the Picts, originated from what is now known as Scotland. More specifically, Senua and her people originate from the Orkney Islands. While it isn't specifically stated in game, through Tameem's comments throughout the Dev Diaries, the player can assume that Senua is the last one of her village, avoiding clashing with the invading Northmen while exiling herself, before Dillion's death.</p>
                    <p>At a young age, Senua's psychosis manifested itself in visions that only she could see, an ailment she shared with her mother, Galena. Though Galena tried to show Senua that her "sight" was a special thing, her druid father, Zynbel, saw their conditions as "darkness", a curse from the gods that would doom them all. To appease those gods, Zynbel killed Galena by burning her alive when Senua was only five. Senua's trauma at witnessing the event caused her psychosis to worsen and repress the memory, leading her to believe that her mother took her own life to escape her darkness.</p>
                    <p>For the next few years of her life, Senua was kept inside her home and abused by Zynbel, both emotionally and physically. He would lock her away in a pit and belittle her condition in an effort to defeat the darkness. On one of the rare occasions she was able to leave, she met Dillion, befriending him after observing him practice his swordplay from afar. The two of them eventually fell in love, and Senua saw Dillion as her one ray of light in her darkness, her one hope in a world that seemed to conspire against her. However, after a plague broke out in Senua's village and killed many, including Dillion's father, Senua began to wonder whether Zynbel was right about her condition being a curse.</p>
                    <p>Senua decided to journey into the Wilds in an effort to protect Dillion and overcome the darkness that plagued her. Out in the Wilds, she encountered Druth, an old scholar who was badly burnt in his attempts to escape his Northmen slave masters. The pair of them bonded as Druth told stories of his captors, giving life to their myths and lore through tales of Norse gods. Though he eventually succumbed to his wounds, he vowed to aid Senua in this life and the next for listening to his stories.</p>
                    <p>However, once Senua returned home, she found that her village had been attacked by the Northmen that Druth had warned her about. She discovered Dillion, sacrificed in a gruesome display of a "blood eagle" to the Norse gods and suffered a psychotic breakdown. Remembering the stories of the gods she was told, Senua reasoned that if she took Dillion's head to Helheim, the Norse realm of the dead, she would be able to bargain with its ruler, Hela, and win back his soul. There was nothing left for Senua but to journey north.</p>
                    <p>After remembering Druth's instructions to reach the borders of Helheim, Senua finds herself on the outskirts and begins to venture in. As she travels further inside, she begins to remember pieces of her past, including her memories of meeting and spending time with Dillion as well as Druth's stories in order to overcome the obstacles that face her. At every turn, the voices of the Furies continue to both taunt and encourage her in a confusing contradiction. She is also pursued by an entity called the Shadow, a dark manifested voice that discourages Senua in her efforts to save Dillion, warning that it will always be with her. Despite the Shadow's attempts to stop her, Senua is able to defeat the gods Surtr and Valravn, as well as the great beast Garm, gaining confidence with each new victory over her foes.</p>
                    <p>By the time that Senua reaches the inner most sanctum of Helheim and meets Hela, she realises that the Shadow is her mind's manifestation of her father, continuing to abuse her even years after her village was attacked. As Hela herself speaks with the Shadow's voice, she charges through wave after wave of Northmen in an attempt to reach the goddess and kill her.</p>
                    <p>When Senua is eventually overwhelmed by her enemies, Hela kneels before her. Senua both curses and pleads with Hela, claiming she's not afraid of sacrificing her life to save Dillion but also begging to set him free. A whirlwind of emotions tears through her mind before finally, Hela kills her. As Senua slumps to the ground, Hela takes Dillion's head to the edge of the battleground and lets it fall into the abyss. As the camera pans back, Hela has become Senua and the corpse on the ground has the appearance of Hela instead.</p>
                    <p>With the guilt of losing Dillion finally lifted from her mind, Senua is able to accept that the voices in her head are not a curse or a darkness, but simply a part of who she is and that it didn't cause all the plague, Northmen invasion, or her mother's death. As the hellish imagery of Helheim fades away, Senua addresses the player, inviting them to follow her and her Furies as they have another story to tell.</p>
