                            <p><span class="strong-text">The Northmen</span>, also known as the Vikings, were a group of Norse seafarers during the late 8th - 11th centuries, who both raided and traded with their Northern European neighbors. Vikings ranged across wide areas of northern and eastern Europe.</p>
                            <p>In Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, the Northmen are responsible for the raiding of Senua's village and the murder of her lover, Dillion. After having learned of their rich mythos from Druth in the wilds before their attack, Senua sets off on a quest to save Dillion's soul from the Northmen's vision of the underworld. During this journey, Senua fights various demonic-looking manifestations of the Northmen along the way.</p>
                            <p>From the way the Northmen are portrayed as monsters wearing masks, it can be assumed they are a product of Senua's mind trying to bring life to the Norse legends that she is convinced are the key to rescuing Dillion's soul and supposed source of her darkness.</p>

                            <p>Surt is a representation of the tyranny that she was under while living with her father.</p>

                            <h3>Hela</h3>
                            <p>After being told of the Northmen's legends by Druth and witnessing the murder of Dillion, Senua becomes convinced that the only way to save Dillion's soul is to bring his head before <span class="strong-text">Hela</span> in her sanctum and bargain with her for his release.</p>
                            <p>Upon first reaching the locked gate to Helheim, Senua is drawn into Hela's shadows. She realizes who she is speaking to and begs Hela to let Dillion go, offering to give her what she wants. As Senua reaches to touch the goddess, she is suddenly shot back to reality as her arm becomes infested with decay thanks to the power of the dark rot.</p>
                            <p>After vanquishing Surtr and Valravn to unlock the gate to the Bridge, Senua is frozen with fear as the doors to Helheim open and Hela's darkness spills out. As the giant goddess begins to emerge and Senua's voices overwhelm her, the Pict charges forward in an attack, but is easily batted away by Hela and sent falling into the abyss below.</p>
                            <p>After Senua is able to reforge Gramr and makes it into Hela's sanctum, she remembers the truth about her mother's death. The goddess taunts her with the Shadow's voice and Senua, revealing that Hela is a manifestation of her own inner darkness, charges forward and vanquishes the onslaught of Northmen brought before her. Hela's giant form begins to shrink to normal human size as Senua gets closer, signifying how the years of abuse she has suffered at the hands of her father hold no power over her. Hela simply watches until Senua is overwhelmed and struck down.</p>
                            <p>Hela approaches a severely wounded Senua, kneeling down to take her sword from her. Senua realizes that if her condition was not a real darkness as her father said, then Hela is not real either and therefore she cannot save Dillion's soul. But she clings desperately to the fantasy, offering up her own soul in exchange for Dillion. Hela does not respond and Senua simply says that she should kill her instead because she has nothing left. Hela obliges, running Senua through with her own weapon.</p>
                            <p>As Senua dies, Hela takes Dillion's head and walks to the edge of her Sanctum. She drops it into the white abyss below and as the camera pans back, Senua has taken Hela's place. With the stigma of her condition no longer holding her back, Senua bids goodbye to Dillion and leaves.</p>
