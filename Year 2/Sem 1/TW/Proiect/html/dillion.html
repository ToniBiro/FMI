                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Dillion was the son of a chieftain of Celts and Senua's friend and eventual lover. A warrior who managed to see Senua for who she was rather than her mental illness, his role in her life would eventually cause her to travel to the very depths of the underworld to save him.</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>Senua first met Dillion many years before the events of the game when they were teenagers. Watching him practice his swordplay from afar at the root of a great tree, she practiced her own techniques for days and days. She eventually worked up the courage to meet him and show off the skills that she had learned from her observation. Dillion, sensing Senua's potential in combat, suggested that she come to watch him take part in the warrior trials and to bring her sword. A ray of hope ignited in her and Senua vowed to leave her father's oppressive rule and join Dillion.</p>
                    <p>After leaving Zynbel, Senua and Dillion spent the next several years together training diligently. In time, Dillion was able to learn of Senua's condition and did whatever he could to support her through it. He would aid her during her moments of blackout with no memory of what she did and would encourage her during moments where she was convinced she had brought suffering to her home. Friendship turned to love and Dillion rarely left her side.</p>
                    <p>One day, a plague struck and Dillion's father was killed in process. Senua was blamed for the outbreak by the other villagers and she became convinced Dillion blamed her for his father's death through her psychosis. That night, Senua contemplated suicide, believing Zynbel was right. Dillion assured her otherwise and implored her to fight the darkness. Wanting to make sure that her illness would never come between them again, Senua ventured out into the wilds in search of penance and Dillion made sure that she promised to come back soon.</p>
                    <p>However, tragedy struck during Senua's absence. Dillion and the other villagers were attacked by the Northmen. While some were captured by slaves, most of them were brutally slain. Dillion in particular was sacrificed in a horrific manner, stretched out in a 'blood eagle' as an offering to the gods. Senua returned to find his half decayed corpse and suffered a breakdown, her Furies screaming that she was responsible for his death.</p>
                    <p>After having learned of the Northmen's legends from Druth while in exile, Senua vowed to save Dillion's soul. She cut off his head and carried it with her, planning to reunite his body with his soul in the depths of Helheim and free him from the grip of the goddess Hela.</p>
